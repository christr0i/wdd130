    <p>Hello, I am from Philippines and a single student. I am grateful to be a part of this class. </p>
    <p>I am currently taking Applied Technology and this is my first semester,  I don't know a lot about programming and all but I kind of find comfort in this course and eager to learn more.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing this course because I want to expand my knowledge in programming and to learn more codes :)</p>
    <p>Mabuhay! </p>
    <p></p>
