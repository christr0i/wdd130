      <h3>Time Management</h3>
      <p>
        There are various studies about time management and in one of the case study of time Dr.Kapur stated that Time management is considered to be a skill that should be mastered by all individuals at all levels and in all walks of life.
        Some people keep extremely busy schedules that arise out of their educational requirements, office work, job duties, or household chores.
        In order to avoid feeling stressed or pressurized due to work, it is required to effectively implement time management. In this case study manuscript, the researcher has highlighted the significance of time management, time management methods, how to effectively implement time management, management of intrusions, management of procrastination, and a case study of valuable time management.
        Time management is also considered to be the management of ones life in an appropriate manner.
        Good time management means deciding what an individual wants to achieve in life and how he should establish ways to attain his desires and objectives. 
        Appropriate time management involves less stress and pressure, increased recreation, more contentment, and greater completion and success.
        Time management is a concept that deals with the effective management of time.
        An individual should organize all his tasks and duties in accordance with the timings; when an individual, no matter what age group he is, no matter what job he is engaged in implements all his functions in accordance with the time that makes him more disciplined, well organized and efficient.
        Time management provides every individual an opportunity to decide how to make use of this important source; it allows people to make the most of the least and it enhances ones knowledge about how to spend time in a constructive manner.
        Individuals become aware of how to systematize and manage their lifestyles and not feel pressurized or overburdened due to any work (Time Management, n.d.).
        Time management is a skill and individuals should learn effective time management irrespective of their age, work, jobs, caste, class, creed or religion.
        It is done in a successful manner by giving priorities; things that are more important should be put into practice first and other things that are lesser important can be procrastinated.
        Practicing time management always prevents an individual from keeping behind in his work and studies. There are steps to manage your time, plan, organized, visualize your goals and make more plans if ever the other fails.
        Valuable time management is life management; when an individual learns to manage his time effectively, he certainly learns to manage his life effectively

      <h3>Using Technology as Tricks to Time</h3>
      <p>
        Technology is evolving in such a fast pace that sometimes we cannot take our time to read and analyze all of the data that are evolving.
        In this promising time, we as the generation that has enveloped in technology must learn to use to our advantage. One of the many example that I want to focus is time. Using technology to organized our timetables and arrange our schedules may be a great advantage in this busy and turbulent generation.
        The fact that we are always busy and sometimes without even noticing we sometimes missed our schedules and it could be start of a bad day. So we as programmers we are making an application that we can all greatly benifit. 
        Even if you are student, a manager, a worker, a director, and whatever profession or status in life, you can all benifit in this great evolution. We present to you the tricks for time and that is to be organized and have a plan. 
        Use technology to our advantage and let our work or time be meaningful each day by being reminded. Just like a couple of cogs if we use it well it will work efficiently and will continue to roll in life.
